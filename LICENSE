The complete software part and website templates is licensed under the MIT License (see below).
However, we use the python rt module that is licensed und GPLv3. As a consequence, this whole
project is distributed under the terms of the GPLv3 even though all SaBot code itself is lisenced
under the terms of the MIT License. If you want to use it under these terms, either disable the RT
support on the code or provide an alternative implementation in sabot/rt.py.

This license does not apply to
- Sample invoice and offer documents provided in invoice/
- Sample sponsor emails in template/sponsor/mails and the
  corresponding config in sponsor/fixtures/mails.json
- Sample config values that are FrOScon specific

We provide those in order to support you with creating your own
conference specific documents/mails/configs. Do not use them in
a production environment.

We redistribute a version of bootstrap (see static/bootstrap/LICENCE)
and a (slightly modified) version of jquery-tablesorter (see
static/tablesorter/LICENSE).
